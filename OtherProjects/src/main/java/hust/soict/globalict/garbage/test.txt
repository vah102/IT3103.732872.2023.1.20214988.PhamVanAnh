My favorite subject is English. The first reason I like this subject is that it is a core subject which is vital and essential in my career path. I try to learn this international language well so that I can communicate with foreigners and find a good job in the future. Fur- thermore, learning English well can help me read books or magazines in English. Through reading things in English, I can be exposed to various cultures and customs. Besides, my English teacher is a dedicated person who can engage me in her lessons and bring the passion for me. I found her lessons interesting be- cause she delivered them in a way that I really liked. In short, English is an important subject which I am really keen on.
